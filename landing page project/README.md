# Landing Page Project done by Shafik Al Sharif

## How to Open in browser using windows

-right click on index.html then choose **open with** and choose your preffered browser

## notes:

In this project ,
-i used js es6 **for of** all the time
-improved performaance while building the NAV bar by writing to fragment
-I also preffered using **Intersection Observer API** instead of the classic Element.getBoundingClientRect()
-also, I changed NAV bar display to flex to have better view on mobile phones
